# FA20_CS551

I took Emory System Programming Course (CS551) on 2020 Fall, taught by Dr. [Ken Mandelberg](http://www.cs.emory.edu/people/faculty/individual.php?NUM=20).    
This is the first time I ever took a course about system programming, and I have learnt a lot from the challenging semester.


I decided to make this repository public available in case any other students want to take it as a reference. Feel free to use my implementation, but also keep in mind the [Honor Code](http://catalog.college.emory.edu/academic/policies-regulations/honor-code.html).
